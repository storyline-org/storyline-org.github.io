    <h1>Audiobook management, reimagined.</h1>
    <p>
        Managing a digital audiobook library shouldn't be this hard. Files scattered across folders, 
        inconsistent metadata, missing cover art, no way to track your progress—it's chaos. 
        Calibre solved this for ebooks years ago, giving readers a powerful tool to organize, edit, and 
        enjoy their collections. Audiobook listeners deserve the same.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Introducing Storyline</h2>
    
    <p>
        Storyline is that solution. Think Calibre, but purpose-built for audio. Beautiful cover art, 
        smart organization by series and author, playback progress tracking—everything 
        you need in one place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Your audiobooks deserve better than a folder full of M4B files. Storyline gives them the home 
        they've been waiting for.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who is Storyline for?</h3>
            <p>
                Storyline is for anyone who collects and listens to audiobooks. Whether you have a small 
                collection or thousands of titles, if you've ever felt frustrated by the lack of good 
                audiobook management tools, Storyline is for you.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is Storyline an Electron app?</h3>
            <p>
                No. Storyline is built using GPUI, a GPU-accelerated Rust framework. This means truly 
                native performance, minimal memory usage, and a responsive interface that feels fast 
                and fluid.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What platforms does Storyline support?</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, Storyline is available for macOS only during the beta period. We're planning 
                to expand to Windows and Linux after the initial release.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What audio formats are supported?</h3>
            <p>
                Storyline supports all common audiobook formats including M4B, M4A, MP3, FLAC, OGG, and 
                more. We handle both single-file audiobooks and multi-file collections.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where is my library data stored?</h3>
            <p>
                Your library metadata is stored locally on your machine. Your actual audiobook files 
                stay exactly where you put them—Storyline never moves or modifies your original files 
                without your permission.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is Storyline open source?</h3>
            <p>
                Not yet. During the beta period, Storyline is closed source. We're planning to open 
                source the project at release. We believe in transparency and community-driven development.
